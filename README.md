# Fitness Tracker

## Description

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

This assignment required me to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View multiple the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.

## Future Development
In the coming weeks, I'd really like to work on the styling of this webpage. Both the medium of the pages and the charts don't look quite as nice as I'd like them to with more sophisticated styling. With time, this will come!
